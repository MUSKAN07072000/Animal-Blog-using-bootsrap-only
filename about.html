                    <h4>Fauna Redeemers,</h4>
                </b>this is a small step to save our beloved
                animals and this ecosystem. Animals played a vital role in managing this ecosystem. Though they are
                extincting rapidly, yet it’s our duty to save them.
                THE BIGGEST THREAT: HUMANS
                Habitat loss—driven primarily by human expansion as we develop land for housing, agriculture, and
                commerce—is the biggest threat facing most animal species, followed by hunting and fishing. Even when
                habitat is not lost entirely, it may be changed so much that animals cannot adapt. Fences fragment a
                grassland or logging cuts through a forest, breaking up migration corridors; pollution renders a river
                toxic; pesticides kill widely and indiscriminately. To those local threats one must increasingly add
                global ones: Trade, which spreads disease and invasive species from place to place, and climate change,
                which eventually will affect every species on Earth—starting with the animals that live on cool
                mountaintops or depend on polar ice. All of these threats lead, directly or indirectly, back to humans
                and our expanding footprint. Most species face multiple threats. Some can adapt to us; others will
                vanish.
                If we lived in an ordinary time—time here being understood in the long, unhurried sense of a geologic
                epoch—it would be nearly impossible to watch a species vanish. Such an event would occur too
                infrequently for a person to witness. In the case of mammals, the best-studied group of animals, the
                fossil record indicates that the “background” rate of extinction, the one that prevailed before humans
                entered the picture, is so low that over the course of a millennium, a single species should disappear
                The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists more than 200 mammal species and subspecies as
                critically endangered. In some cases, like the Sumatran rhino or the vaquita—a porpoise native to the
                Gulf of California—there are fewer than a hundred individuals left. In others, like the baiji (also
                known as the Yangtze River dolphin), the species, though not yet officially declared extinct, has
                probably died out.The huge diversity of work performed by animals ranges from transportation to hunting
                to assisting the blind. Even in the automotive era, "horsepower" survives as a unit of measurement.
                Egyptian illustrations from 5,000 years ago show oxen pulling plows, and cattle have historically been
                used more than horses as draft animals. Service dogs offer their senses of sight, hearing and smell to
                aid people with disabilities and perform law-enforcement duties. They are allowed to enter public spaces
                like stores and restaurants where pets are not normally permitted.Animals As Resources
                Cattle, pigs, poultry and fish feed us, but the consumers buying their meat as food are far removed from
                the animals themselves. The USDA puts 2013 meat consumption levels of 25.5 billion pounds of beef alone.
                Beef exports added $5.7 billion to the economy. Economic pressures lead to large livestock operations,
                which bring their own problems like disease control and manure disposal, leading to algal blooms in
                streams and lakes. This consequence is also important to human-animal relationships, even though humans
                don't interact directly with the animals. The US Environmental Protection Agency regulates these
                operations. At the same time, smaller-scale operations seek to preserve heritage breeds of livestock,
                who retain traits of self-sufficiency and resilience.Less than 2,000 or so of this breed of zebra were
                left in the wild in 2011, making the Grevy’s zebra the most threatened of any type of zebra, according
                to the Wildlife Extra website. Where more than 15,000 once lived in countries such as Kenya and
                Ethiopia, the Grevy’s zebra has been much reduced in population thanks to the disintegration of its
                natural habitat and hunting by humans. Disease and competition with other animals has added to the
                Grevy’s zebras' woes.</p>
